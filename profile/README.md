The AnonLinuxOS collective is working on [KOLOS](https://github.com/AnonLinuxOS/KOLOS), an immutable Linux distribution for handheld gaming devices developed by a small community of enthusiasts. Our goal is to produce an operating system that has the features and capabilities that we need, and to have fun as we develop it.

## Project Inception
This decentralized hacker collective was founded on May 8th 2024 as the result of forking [JELOS](https://github.com/JustEnoughLinuxOS) right after their projects was archived, we are standing on the shoulders of [Super Giants](https://github.com/JustEnoughLinuxOS/distribution/graphs/contributors).

> [!NOTE]
> Releases of the KOLOS Linux distribution will be published in the up-coming weeks.
